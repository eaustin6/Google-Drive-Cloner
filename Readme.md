Using the code as shown in the following Image you can copy data from My Drive to Shared Drive, Just replace "FILE NAME" with File you have to copy from My Drive and replace "SHARED DRIVE NAME" with Shared Drive Name to which you have to copy data. Also if you like to copy all Data from My Drive at once then remove "FILE NAME" and directly Enter "SHARED DRIVE NAME" and hit "Play Code" Button. </h4>

<h2> 🤔 Why Use This?</h2>
<h4>If you use Google Collab for Long term use, then you can understand that it requires Human Interaction atleast one time per 90 Minutes! Otherwise it will cancel the task and all your Work will got failed! But this Repository comes with the code which prevent this. Yes you heard it right just click on the "Play Code Button" of last Cell and then don't worry about time out! Also sometimes it become defficult to upload Files directly to Shared Drives, So we have added a dedicated Shared Drive Section in the UI. We update every Repository on a regular Basis and fix Problems reported to us by our Users!</h4>
